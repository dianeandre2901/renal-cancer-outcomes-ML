# Renal Cancer Outcomes Prediction – MSc Thesis

This project aims to predict renal cancer outcomes (Survival) using high-resolution histopathology images of renal tissue and machine learning techniques.

The focus will be on developing and evaluating models that can extract interesting features from tissue images, including:

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Transfer learning
- Interpretable vision transformers 
- Other supervised machine learning approaches

This work is my Master's thesis in Health Data Analytics and Machine Learning and will include exploratory experiments on publicly available datasets (e.g. TCGA-KIRC)
